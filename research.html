            ## Getting Started
            
            ### Accessing Library Services
            To use IIT library services, you need an **IIT Hawk Card**, which you can obtain via the [Hawk Card Homepage](#). Your Hawk Card allows you to check out physical materials from Galvin Library and request interlibrary loans. However, you can still access online journals and use search functions without it.
            
            ### Using myIIT to Access the Library Website
            The best way to access library resources is through **myIIT**:
            
            1. Log in to myIIT.
            2. Click on **Library Resources**.
            
            This method provides a proxy server connection, enabling seamless access to most resources.
            
            ![Library Services icon leading to search website](research2.jpg)
            
            Once on the library website, use the left-hand navigation bar to explore research databases such as **Academic Search Premier (EBSCO)**.

            ## Research Timelines
            
            ### Formulating a Timeline
            A realistic research timeline ensures you have enough time to acquire, read, and integrate resources before your deadline. Consider this formula:
            
            **Time to obtain resource + Time to read + Time to integrate < Time before deadline**
            
            #### Key Considerations
            - **Time to obtain**: How long will it take to access the resource?
            - **Time to read**: Can you realistically read the material in time?
            - **Time to integrate**: Do you have time to incorporate it into your project?
            - **Remaining time before the deadline**: Is it feasible to adjust your research approach?
            
            #### Example: Bridgette's Research Timeline
            Bridgette, a graduate student, creates a timeline in **Google Calendar** to track resource requests, reading schedules, and writing deadlines. This allows her to stay on track while researching technical communication history.
            
            ---
            
            ## Requesting Resources
            
            ### Requesting Articles
            If an article isn’t available as a **.pdf**, use the **Get Article** link:
            
            ![Example of requesting an article](research4_image1.jpg)
            
            You may be redirected to **MyILL**, where you can request the article. 
            
            ![MyILL request page](research4_image2.jpg)
            
            To use **MyILL**, register separately from **myIIT**. You will be notified by email when your article is ready for download.
            
            ### Requesting Books from Other Libraries
            Follow these steps:
            1. Search the **IIT library system**.
            2. If unavailable, check **I-Share**.
            3. If still unavailable, search **WorldCat**.
            
            #### Keeping Track of Resources
            - Maintain a **Google Doc** or **flash drive** list of all books and articles you plan to use.
            - Preview books using **Google Books** or **book reviews** before requesting them.
            
            ---
            
            ## Local Libraries
            
            ### I-Share Libraries
            Many I-Share libraries allow you to check out books with an **IIT ID card**. The **Daley Library at UIC** has an open-stacks policy and extensive resources.
            
            Before visiting:
            - Verify the **library’s location and hours**.
            - Confirm **public access policies**.
            
            ### Public Libraries
            The **Chicago Public Library (CPL)** system offers additional resources, including textbooks. If you don’t live in Chicago, you can still visit CPL locations to read and copy materials.
            
            #### Example: Obtaining a Resource from a Local Library
            Bridgette needs the book *English for Engineers* but has only **ten days** left before her deadline. Since waiting for an interlibrary loan is too risky, she checks **UIC’s library website**, confirms availability, and retrieves the book in person.
            
            ---
            
            ## Finding Resources on the Web
            
            ### Key Online Research Tools
            - **Google Scholar**: Tracks citations and related research.
            - **Google Books**: Provides previews and full-text access to some books.
            - **Web of Science**: Similar to Google Scholar but focused on scientific publications.
            
            #### Example: Using Web Resources
            Bridgette questions the arguments in an article she’s using. She searches its title on **Google Scholar** and finds **62 citations**, allowing her to evaluate how other researchers have referenced the work.

            ## Final Thoughts
            By starting early and utilizing various research methods, you can efficiently gather and integrate high-quality resources into your work. Now, take the **quiz** to reinforce your understanding of these research strategies.

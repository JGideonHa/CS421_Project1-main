      <p>This lesson is designed to help students conduct effective academic research. After completing this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Search for relevant academic papers and articles</li>
        <li>Evaluate sources for credibility</li>
        <li>Organize your research and cite sources correctly</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Search for Relevant Research</h2>
      <p>Start by using academic databases such as Google Scholar, JSTOR, or IEEE Xplore to find peer-reviewed journal articles. Look for papers published in reputable journals or conferences related to your research topic.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use keywords and boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT) to narrow down your search.</li>
        <li>Evaluate the abstracts and conclusions of papers to determine their relevance to your research question.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Evaluate Sources for Credibility</h2>
      <p>Not all sources are equally credible. Be sure to evaluate your sources by:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Checking the author‚Äôs credentials and institutional affiliation.</li>
        <li>Looking for citations of the paper in other reputable works.</li>
        <li>Reviewing the methodology and sample size used in the study.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Organize Your Research</h2>
      <p>Once you‚Äôve found relevant papers, it‚Äôs important to organize them effectively:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use reference management software (e.g., Zotero, EndNote) to collect and organize your research.</li>
        <li>Tag papers with keywords to make retrieval easier later.</li>
        <li>Note the key findings, methods, and citations for each source.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Cite Your Sources</h2>
      <p>Proper citation is essential to avoid plagiarism and give credit to the original authors. Make sure to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Follow a consistent citation style (e.g., APA, MLA, Chicago).</li>
        <li>Use citation generators or management tools to automate the process (e.g., Zotero, Mendeley).</li>
      </ul>

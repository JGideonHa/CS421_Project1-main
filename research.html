        <h1>Realistic Research: University, Web-based, and Local Resources</h1>
        <p>This lesson is meant for students who must begin research in their first semester of the TCID, IA, or the Ph.D. in Technical Communication program.</p>

    <section class="content-areas">
        <h2>Content Areas</h2>
        <p>This lesson will help you learn to acquire research resources through a review of the following areas:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Getting Started</li>
            <li>Research Timelines</li>
            <li>Requesting Resources</li>
            <li>Local Libraries</li>
            <li>Finding Resources on the Web</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="getting-started">
        <h2>Getting Started</h2>
        <h3>Accessing Library Services</h3>
        <p>If you are a newly admitted student and you have not obtained an IIT Hawk Card, details for doing so can be found at the Hawk Card Homepage. You will need your Hawk Card number to access some library services.</p>
        <p>Even if you don't have a Hawk Card, you can still access online journals and perform all of the search functions through the library website.</p>
        
        <h3>Using myIIT to Access the Library Website</h3>
        <p>The best way to access the library website is to log on to myIIT. Once logged in, you will see a link to "Library Resources."</p>

        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="research2.jpg" alt="Library Services Icon">
            <p class="caption">CAPTION: The Library Services icon leads you to the library search website.</p>
        </div>

    <section id="research-timelines">
        <h2>Research Timelines</h2>
        <h3>Formulating a Timeline</h3>
        <p>It is important to first consider your due date when thinking about requesting resources. You must have enough time to read the material, integrate it into your project or paper, and still have time to finish your assignment.</p>
        <p>In general, consider this formula when determining whether it is realistic to use a resource for your paper:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Time to obtain resource</li>
            <li>Time to read resource</li>
            <li>Time to integrate resource into your project</li>
            <li>Remaining time before deadline</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="sidebar">
            <p><strong>Being Realistic:</strong> Don't assume that you can read an entire scholarly book in one day.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Case Study: Example of a Research Timeline</h3>
        <p>Bridgette is a graduate student in the Tech Comm program who has been assigned a literature review and research paper...</p>

    <section id="requesting-resources">
        <h2>Requesting Resources</h2>
        <h3>Requesting Articles</h3>
        <p>Occasionally, some articles are not available for download as a .pdf file through a journal or academic search engine...</p>
        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="research4_image1.jpg" alt="Article Request">
            <p class="caption">CAPTION NOT AVAILABLE</p>
        </div>

        <div class="image-container">
            <img src="research4_image2.jpg" alt="MyILL Request">
            <p class="caption">For this resource, the only option is to request the article through MyILL</p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section id="local-libraries">
        <h2>Local Libraries</h2>
        <h3>I-Share Libraries</h3>
        <p>Many I-Share libraries will allow you to pull books directly from the shelf...</p>

        <div class="sidebar">
            <p><strong>Being Realistic:</strong> Don't waste your research time by making the trip to a library only to find out it is closed for break.</p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section id="web-resources">
        <h2>Internet Resources</h2>
        <h3>Some resources to consider</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Public domain writings</li>
            <li>Resources licensed under Creative Commons</li>
            <li>Media files such as video, audio, and images</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Some web resources can help you find additional resources, such as Google Scholar and Web of Science.</p>

        <div class="sidebar">
            <p><strong>Being Realistic:</strong> Try searching for a special issue, yearbook, or edited volume on your topic. Collections like these offer you a snapshot of collective scholarship.</p>
